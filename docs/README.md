# Collar Metrics Service API
Adheres to [JSON API](http://jsonapi.org/) specification. This means that all
messages will use `application/vnd.api+json` mime type. For the sake of energy
efficiency, devices may choose to queue events locally and deliver them to this
service in batches.

All API requests require an `:id` parameter, which is the globally unique
device id of the collar. 

## Bark Events

### POST /collar/:id/barks/new
```json
{
  "data": [{
    "type": "barks",
    "attributes": {
      "timestamp": "2018-01-14 18:32:01T+0600",
      "volume": 3
    }
  }]
}
```
The objects described in the `data` element will be appended to the collection
of barks known for this device.

### GET /collar/:id/barks
```json
{
  "data": [{
    "type": "barks",
    "attributes": {
      "timestamp": "2018-01-14 18:32:01T+0600",

    }
  },{
    "type": "barks",
    "attributes": {
      "timestamp": "2018-01-14 18:32:04T+0600",
      "volume": 5
